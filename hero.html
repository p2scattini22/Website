<p>Hilary Hahn is an American violinist who is considered one of the finest solo violinists of her generation. She was born on November 27,1979 in Lexington, Virginia. At age three, Ms. Hahn began taking Suzuki (a method of violin teaching) lessons at the Peabody Conservatory in Maryland. By age ten, she was admitted into the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where, in 1999, she earned her bachelor's degree. At 11 years old, Ms. Hahn performed as a soloist with the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia and in 1991, she made her first major orchestral appearance with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In 1995, Ms. Hahn gained international attention when she performed in Germany with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, which was broadcasted on TV and radio throughout Europe. By age 16, she became one of the youngest musicians to land an exclusive recording contract with Sony Classical Records. They signed her onto a six year agreement for five recordings. When her contract expired, Ms. Hahn signed with the Deutsche Grammophon Label. She has performed with the world's most elite orchestras in more than 200 major cities across the world. By 28, Ms. Hahn had won several awards, including two Grammy Awards. She has recorded numerous albums and provided music for film, including The Village (2004). She has inspired younger audiences with her personal website, her own YouTube channel, and her social media. In 2015, she won her third Grammy Award in the best chamber music performance in her album, In 27 Pieces: The Hilary Hahn Encores. She featured 27 pieces for violin recently composed. 

<p>As a fellow violinist, Hilary Hahn has a major influence in my life. I began listening to her music when I was very young and I still listen to her to this day. She is a big inspiration to me and I have played several of the pieces she has played too. Listening to those pieces really inspired me and it makes me motivated to practice. Of course, I admit that I'll never be as good as Ms. Hahn, but she still gives me a lot of motivation. I find her life so fascinating and even better, she's still so young! Ms. Hahn still has a lot of life left and as I continue my violin journey, I am excited to stay up to date with her life as well. She is a really amazing person and she is someone I think about a lot.
