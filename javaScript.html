	3. Let them guess again and guess an endlss amount of times until they get it, all while telling them if it's too high or too low.
	4. It also needs to keep track of how many inputs the user has put in and display that back to them if they win.
	5. If it is equal, alert them they won. If not, tell them to keep going. 
	6. If they do guess it, end the function and tell them the number of times it took them and tell them they won. 
	
		Write n algorithm to create a guessing game.
		Let the user know if the guess is too high or too low.
		If they guess the number, alert this fact and tell them how many guesses it took them to guess the number.
